#Create a program to analyze a large block of text and report back on the frequency of each word in the text.
#a. Start by sorting the text into a hash where each word is a key with the wordâ€™s value being the amount of times it has been used in the block:
#example :{the: 10, john: 1, of: 15}

                fizz,fizzbuzzzz,buzzzzzzzzzzzz,buzzz,buzzfizzz,buzzz,fizz,fizz"
