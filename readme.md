=================
   Create a program to analyze a large block of text and report back on the frequency of each word in the text.

   1- Start by sorting the text into a hash where each word is a key with the word’s value being the amount of 
       times it has been used in the block: for instance  {the: 10, john: 1, of: 15}

   2 -Once you’ve created this hash, return the word that has been used the most

   3- When you’re done, encapsulate your script inside of a method that can analyze any block of text fed to it
